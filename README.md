ðŸ§  Code-first. Bullshit-last.

 I'm a backend-heavy software engineer with a taste for high-load systems, full-stack app architecture, and open-source chaos. I architect and build things that scale, survive, and self-heal - from microservices to SOA beasts: mostly with Python and Go as my weapons of choice.
 
My current playground is the serverless and cloud-native world - AWS, Terraform, event-driven pipelines, infra as code - all the gritty backend ops that keep the lights on and the pagers silent.

Iâ€™ve been getting my hands dirty with AI too - running LLMs under RAG setups, wiring AI agents to workflows, and working with computer vision models for real-world decision making.

Iâ€™m passionate about sharing knowledge - mentoring younger devs, running lectures, and guiding teams through complex technical challenges. Troubleshooting is my detective story - chasing down obscure bugs, dissecting failures, and uncovering root causes that hide in plain sight.
Native of a small city, citizen of the tech world. Once I was slicing table-based layouts for lunch money. Now Iâ€™m designing platforms that donâ€™t blink under pressure. Still hungry, still building, still learning
